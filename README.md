# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
With this task we were presented with starter code for a scheduler, adding on to it the workday scheduler will now present you with the current date and bring you to the current time. It will also present you with the rest of the hours of the day which are in green, the current hour is in red and the previous hours are in gray. You are also able to save any notes you add to specific hours on the scheduler. If the page is closed, the saved meeting is still presented to you when the page is next opened.
